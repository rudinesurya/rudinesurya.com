            This is a RESTful api that is responsible for providing data to the
            React client app. The Api accepts json content query parameters in
            requests and all responses are encoded in JSON, including errors.
            <br />
            <br />
            This app has been developed for desktop web platform with JavaScript
            and Node.

            This is an educational app developed in requirement for the Web
            Enterprise Development Course which I undertook during my MSc in
            Computing.

            <br />
            Adhering to best practices recommended for creating RESTful API,
            this app has adopted the Clean Architecture pattern and supports the
            idea of separation of concern, making the model, endpoints and
            business logic independent of each other. Common functionalities
            like querying, filtering, sorting, pagination are also implemented
            to allow MongoDB to serve the required content to the user. Third
            party services like Pusher enable the client app to listen for
            changes in the server. Also present in this app is graceful error
            handling and logging which enable developers to diagnose uncaught
            exceptions.

            Experience in unit testing using Mocha, Chai and Supertest. Follows
            best practices and keeping test cases as isolated as possible.
