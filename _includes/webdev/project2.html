            FastJobs Api is a RESTful interface, providing access to most of the
            data in the system. The Api accepts json content query parameters in
            requests and all responses are encoded in JSON, including errors.

              Adhering to best practices recommended for creating Rest API.
              Adopted Clean Architecture. It supports the idea of separation of
              concern, making the model, endpoints and business logic
              independent of each other.

              Server side validations.

            <li>
              Adhering to the best practices, we gracefully handle errors,
              without crashing the server, and use appropriate http status codes
              and error messages. Boom provides a set of utilities for returning
              HTTP errors, which allows consistency and cleaner error handling.

              Pagination is the practice of splitting a huge ordered list of
              content into pages to be served to the user. With the correct
              usage, pagination not only reduce the network traffic generated by
              the web app, but it also can enhance the user experience by
              providing fast loading and page navigation. This also prevents the
              user from being overwhelmed by too much data at any one time.
