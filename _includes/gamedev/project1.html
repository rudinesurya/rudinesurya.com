            Ether Lunu is a first person platformer shooter. In Ether Lunu, the
            protagonist uses his power called Ether to perform Sun Bust to get
            around the level, avoid traps and reach to the goal.â€‹

            Engine was built from the ground up in C++.

            <strong>Role</strong>
          </h3>
          <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>
              Set up the ground work for the Game Engine using C++ and DirectX.
              Also in charge of the physics engine (collision
              detection/response, raycasting).
            </li>
            <li>
              Research and develop improvements to the Game Engine. Such as
              rendering optimization via frustum culling, collission detection
              optimization via hierarchical trivial rejection checks (Bounding
              sphere -> axis align bounding box -> obb) to prevent unnecessary
              calculations when they are not needed. And more accurate collider
              implementation via oriented bounding box and they perform
              collision detection using Separation Axis Theorem.
            </li>
            <li>
              Play a part in the creation of the level editor by assisting in
              optimizing workflow of assets coming from the designers and
              transporting them into the game system through an XML interface.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementation of a simple AI system using finate state machine.
              This allows easy creation of agents' or traps' behaviour which has
              very simple mind of its own, and always react to state changes.
