        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          A little about myself, I have programmed for over 7 years now. I
          started learning programming because I wanted to make games. I started
          learning C and C++ in Game Development (2011) before I move to a more
          general development role in 2016. My main focus includes mobile
          application development for the Android platform, along with frontend
          and backend web development.

        <p class="lead">
          My area of interests are game development, artificial intelligence,
          machine learning and graphics. On the other hand, my non-professional
          interests includes gaming, chilling with movies/shows, and travelling.

        <h3>Why hire me ?</h3>

        <p class="lead">
          Despite lacking the work experience that most jobs require, I possess
          the ability to pick up new technologies rather quickly and adapt to
          different working environments. I pay attention to writing clean and
          robust codes and following industry best practices.
